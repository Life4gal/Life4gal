Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is an anxiety 
disorder characterized by sentiments of fear and anxiety in social situations, 
causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least 
some aspects of daily life. These fears can be triggered by perceived or
actual scrutiny from others. Individuals with social anxiety disorder fear 
negative evaluation from other people.

Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality 
disorder (MPD), is a mental  disorder characterized by the maintenance of at
